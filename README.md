This module provides professional service listing functionality for Magento 2, allowing customers to create and manage their professional profiles, which can be reviewed and approved by administrators.

## How It Works

### Profile Feature Management

The module uses a sophisticated system to manage profile features based on subscriptions and orders:

1. **Order Requirements**:
   - Features are only activated when the associated order has a **COMPLETE** status
   - Pending or processing orders will not activate profile features

2. **Automated Checks**:
   - A cron job runs every hour to:
     - Verify subscription status
     - Check feature expiration dates
     - Update profile visibility in OpenSearch
     - Deactivate expired features automatically

3. **Feature Activation**:
   - Features are tied to specific products (e.g., `psl_profile_geolocation`)
   - Each feature is independently managed
   - Features are only active with valid subscriptions and complete orders
